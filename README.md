AntiCopyPaster Tutorial for ASE 2022

This repository contains an education notbook as well as environment set to show the process behind developing the AntiCopyPaster intellij plugin
(https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/anti-copy-paster).

This tutorial is done through Jupyter Notebook and will require python3 as well as the following packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn,
tensorflow, and keras.

A virtual environment that contains all of these packages can be set up with the command: source createEnv.sh

Once the environment is set, the jupyter notebook can be accessed with the command: jupyter notebook antiCopyPasterTutorial.ipynb

After the notebook is set up, the tutorial can be done cell by cell.
